<h1>Pado Desktop</h1>
	PADO Desktop on Web is launched by JNLP. With the proper security
	settings, JNLP launched applications can run just like any stand-alone
	applications with full access to the local file system and network.
	PADO Desktop on Web is configured as such and has the same look and
	feel of the stand-alone PADO Desktop.
	<p>
	<h2>Launching PADO Desktop for the First Time</h2>
	The following steps must be taken before you can successfully launch
	PADO Desktop:
	<ol>
		<li>Download and save the self-signed certificate in your local
			file system by clicking here: <a href="desktop/pado-web.csr">Netcrest
				Trusted Certificate</a>
		</li>
		<li>Import the self-signed security certificate from Java Control
			Panel</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Open Java Control Panel. On Windows, select "Java" in
				Control Panel. On Mac, select "Java" in System Preferences.</li>
			<li>Select the "Security" tab.</li>
			<li>Select the "Manage Certificates..." button.</li>
			<li>Select "Signer CA" from the combobox.</li>
			<li>Select the "Import" button.</li>
			<li>Import the downloaded certificate.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Launch PADO Desktop by clicking here: <a
			href="javascript:deployJava.launchWebStartApplication('desktop/pado-desktop.jnlp');">Launch
				Pado Desktop</a></li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	<h2>Desktop Login</h2>
	PADO requires you to login with proper credentials before you can
	access the grids. The login window lists the available grid
	environments in the "Env" combobox. The "_USER" environment is for you
	to enter locators of your choice in the "Locators" text field. The
	other environments listed in the combobox are pre-configured for you
	and their locators cannot be changed.
	<h2>Desktop Template</h2>
	When you launch PADO Desktop for the first time, you may see a blank
	desktop. You can start laying out the screen by splitting a worksheet
	into "quads" and dropping components from the Bean Bar into the empty
	quads. An easier way is to open the pre-built template that has most of
	the essential components to monitor and control the PADO grids as
	follows:
	<ul>
		<li>From the menubar, <i>Select File/Open Template</i></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Reinstalling PADO Desktop</h2>
	At times, JNLP may not launch PADO Desktop due to the staled resources.
	You can reinstall PADO Desktop by deleting the Java Cache as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Open Java Control Panel - On Windows, this is found in
			Control Panel. On Mac, this is found in System Preferences.</li>
		<li>From the "General tab, select "Settings..."</li>
		<li>From the "Temporary Files Settings" window, select "Delete
			Files..."</li>
		<li>To reinstall, select "Installed Applications and Applets" and
			then the "OK" button.</li>
	</ul>
